# My journey to a VHDL compiler

This is my attempt to recreate a vhdl compiler in C++, primarily to learn compiler basics (I am a Electrical Engineering graduate). So I will first be analyzing [ghdl]( https://github.com/tgingold/ghdl) ie, writing regular blogs on what I understand and what I dont, and then elaborate it in C++ XD, maybe also learning ADA in the process.

I don't really think that I will get anything close to a ghdl replacement but can't hurt to try ;)
