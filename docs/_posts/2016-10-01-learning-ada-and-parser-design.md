title: Learning ADA and parser design
---
Apparently ghdl is written almost entirely in ADA, which kinda sucks because I have never ~~seen~~ used the language before. But I feel I usually am quick to pick up the languages *atleast the reading part*.

I primarily used [this tutorial](http://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/~pautet/Ada95/a95list.htm) to learn ADA95 as I think that mostly covers what is used to write the ghdl source. I read till the loops and other common constructs ~~till I fell asleep~~. I decided to look into more complicated things as they will be needed.

I also decided to go for the LLVM backend ~~because its a fad~~ so that I get to pick up another useful skill.
