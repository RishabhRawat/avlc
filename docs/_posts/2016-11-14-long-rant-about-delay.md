title: A long rant about previous month
---
Its more that a month since my last post, well I ended up being really busy to finish up my DDP (Dual Degree Project) stage 1, and it was a really terrible experience. I think writing research papers in the last moment is not my cup of tea :P. First two weeks were full on report writing and presentations, by the time it ended I was too frustrated. So I took a break, waited for my laptop to return (It finally did after staying one month in hospital). 

Then it was the onslaught of placement PPTs/Tests etc and end-semesters. I am also helping part time in a startup, so there was that. And I finally manned up to hit a gym... well no comments there. 

So finally now that I got some time and motivation I wrote this blog, as for future it is still looking bleak. I have upcoming poster presentation and a full on assault of placements. Hopefully I will be done by that by first week of December, after which I am going back to home, after one whole year, yeaaahhh!!

So yeah keep an eye here mysterious stranger hopefully I would get around to doing some real work
