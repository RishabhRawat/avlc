avlc (Another VHDL Language Compiler) is exactly what it sounds like.

Recently I got more and more interested in the compiler design and was looking for good project ideas, (which are really hard to come by). After GSoC I got really interested in contributing to the Open Source Hardware, and so avlc happened.

### Goals
I will try to achieve the following (Ordered by priority) in long term provided the interest stays :P

* Make a fully compatible VHDL compiler/simulator
* Create a set of VHDL linting tools
* Create a syntax formatter for VHDL

I will also be writing a series of blog posts just describing my journey *(like a journal)*. It is not meant to be formal or grammatically accurate. Though I would love if you point out any grammatical *(or other)* errors. ~~who am I kidding aint nobody got time to read this shit~~

All the sources (anything outside the docs/ folder and written by me) would be licensed LGPL, unless Tristan Gingold (maintained of GHDL) or someone else wants it to be licensed differently.

I maintain that the tools is just an academic exercise (till it becomes more than that), and not to base any production environment on it
